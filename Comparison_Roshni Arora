Integration Ease:
Auth0: Using SDKs and libraries, Auth0 facilitates simple integration with a range of platforms and frameworks. It provides developers with easy-to-read instructions
and assistance in implementing authentication rapidly.
Firebase Authentication: Firebase Authentication supports several authentication methods and provides easy interaction with Firebase's toolkit. 
Its SDKs are user-friendly and kept up to date.

Features and Personalization:
Auth0: Auth0 provides a wide range of customization options, such as user profile management, multi-factor authentication, password policies, and
customized login flows. It gives developers the freedom to customize the authentication experience and supports a large variety of authentication techniques.
Firebase Authentication: This method offers a minimal amount of control over UI elements and authentication routines. 
Although it does a good job of covering typical authentication cases, it does not have as many sophisticated features or customization options as Auth0.

Safety:
Auth0: Auth0 is a security-focused protocol that works with industry-standard protocols such as OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0.
Strong security measures are put in place to guard user information and stop frequent dangers like account theft and brute-force attacks.
Firebase Authentication: To guarantee secrecy, Firebase Authentication encrypts user data and places a high priority on security.
It provides features like safe token creation and anti-account misuse defense. In contrast to Auth0, there might be less control over security configurations.

Scalability

Auth0: Auth0 can efficiently process authentication requests even during peak loads because it is designed to manage large-scale authentication requirements.
It provides scalability without sacrificing efficiency.
Moreover scalable and able to manage authentication requests from tiny to large applications is Firebase Authentication.
It keeps excellent performance and scales smoothly as your application grows.

Price:

Auth0: Based on the quantity of active users and extra features, Auth0 provides a tiered price structure. Although it offers a free tier with restricted
functionality, there can be expenses involved with scaling above the free tier.
Firebase Authentication: This service provides a substantial, usage-limited free tier. Firebase's pricing is usually thought to be competitive, 
while there may be expenses associated with extra functionality and usage beyond the free tier.

Lock-in of the vendor:

Auth0: Since Auth0 is an independent identity management platform, integrating with it does not bind your program to a particular ecosystem of vendors.
Using Firebase Authentication links your application to the Google ecosystem because it is a component of Google's Firebase platform.
Compared to Auth0, moving authentication away from Firebase might take more work.
