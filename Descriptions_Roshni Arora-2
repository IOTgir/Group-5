Option-1 
Rely on the Auth0 identity platform to add sophisticated authentication and authorization to your applications.
Centralize and manage users from multiple identity providers, giving them branded,
seamless signup and login experiences. Finely control access with a degree of customization that can accommodate even the most complex security requirements.
Option-2
Firebase Authentication integrates tightly with other Firebase services, and it leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect,
so it can be easily integrated with your custom backend.
Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app.
It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, and popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
