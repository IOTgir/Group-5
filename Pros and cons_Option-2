Pros:
1. Simple Integration: Integrating authentication into your application is made simple with Firebase Authentication, 
which offers straightforward SDKs for several platforms and frameworks. Developers can set up social authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.),
phone number, email and password, and more with just a few lines of code.
2. Scalability: Firebase Authentication can handle authentication requests from tiny applications to massive deployments with millions of users since it is designed to grow.
It keeps up with the expansion of your application without sacrificing speed.
3. Security: Industry-standard authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are supported by Firebase Authentication,
which employs strong security features including encryption of user data and defense against common threats like brute-force assaults and account hijacking.
4. Pre-built user interface (UI): components are available from Firebase for authentication flows such as account management, password reset, login, and registration.
These components save time and effort during development because they are readily integrated into the user interface of your program and are customizable.
5. Analytics and Insights: Developers may obtain insights into user activity, authentication patterns, and engagement metrics by integrating 
Firebase Authentication with Firebase Analytics. The user experience can be improved by using this data, and authentication mechanisms can be adjusted accordingly.

Cons: 
1. Vendor Lock-in: By connecting your application to Google's ecosystem with Firebase Authentication, you run the risk of experiencing vendor lock-in.
Moving your authentication to a different platform and rebuilding portions of your application can be necessary if you ever decide to leave Firebase.
2. Limited Customization: Firebase Authentication might not meet all sophisticated customization needs, even if it provides basic customization possibilities
for authentication routines and user interface elements. Firebase's customization features could not meet the needs of developers who require highly
customized authentication experiences.
3. Complexity for Advanced Features: Although Firebase Authentication provides out-of-the-box coverage for common authentication scenarios, 
implementing more sophisticated features like fine-grained access control, custom authentication methods, or multi-factor authentication (MFA) may
necessitate extra work and workarounds.
4. Data Privacy and Compliance: Using Firebase Authentication entails giving Google access to user authentication data, just like with any other third-party service. 
For legal compliance and to preserve user confidence, it is essential to ensure compliance with data privacy standards (such GDPR) and 
comprehend the ramifications of storing user data using Firebase.
5. Cost: Although Firebase Authentication has a free tier with generous use restrictions, employing more Firebase capabilities or scaling over those limits may
result in additional expenditures. As their program expands, developers should keep a close eye on usage and think carefully
about the price structure to minimize unforeseen costs.
